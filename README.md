# Robotics Domain Ontology (RDO)
The Robotics Domain Ontology (RDO) describes the basic entities of a common Indoor Robot domain. 

## Imported Ontologies
It contains RDO-specific classes and axioms as well as imports from:  
    1. Information Artifact Ontology ([IAO](http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/IAO))  

## How to use it
This ontology was built using the [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) editor, from Stanford University.
If you would like to use it, just download the **rdo.owl** file and import it into Protégé editor.


## Disclaimer
The RDO ontology was built during the Ontology Engineering class, from a master's degree in Computer Science of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. It means that this is not a production-ready ontology.
